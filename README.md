# Welcome to Fast Food!
Our app is designed to get you to the recipes you want, without making you scroll through a novel first. Don’t care what you eat, as long as it has bacon in it? Try out our search by ingredient function to get some recipe ideas. If you have a particular dish in mind, go ahead and just search for that recipe.

___App Structure___  
This particular app is actually made up of two different rails apps: one for the front end, and one for the backend. Our backend app makes external API calls to The Meal DB and preserves the data while altering the formatting to optimize it for our front - end app. The
```
===Backend App===
Our app uses the endpoints provided by The Meal DB.  
The back end was to preserve the data coming through those
endpoints while altering the formatting to optimize it for front-end.
```
```
===Frontend App===

The front end app is responsible for the OAuth log in exchange with
Google which gives users the ability to register using their existing
Gmail account. Our front end app is responsible for displaying the data
given back to us from our API and is stylized using Bootstrap.
