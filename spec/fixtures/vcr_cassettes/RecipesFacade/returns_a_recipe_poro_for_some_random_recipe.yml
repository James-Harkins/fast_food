        minute potato gratin with chicken and bacon greens: a gratin always seems
        more effort and more indulgent than ordinary boiled or roasts, but it doesn''t
        have to take 45mins, it''s nice for a change and you can control the calorie
        content by going with full fat to low fat creme fraiche. (It''s always tastes
        better full fat though obviously!) to serve 4: use 800g of potatoes, finely
        slice and boil in a pan for about 5-8 mins till firmish, not soft. Finely
        slice 3 onions and place in an oven dish with 2 tblsp of olive oil and 100ml
        of chicken stock. Cook till the onions are soft then drain the potatoes and
        pour onto the onions. Season and spoon over cream or creme fraiche till all
        is covered but not swimming. Grate Parmesan over the top then finish under
        the grill till nicely golden. serve with chicken and bacon, peas and spinach.","category":"Chicken","area":"Unknown"}}}'
