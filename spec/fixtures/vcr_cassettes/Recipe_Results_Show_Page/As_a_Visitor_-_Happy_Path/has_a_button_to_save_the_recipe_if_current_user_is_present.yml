        oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 10x14x2-inch baking pan.\r\nHeat
        margarine in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion. Cook and stir until
        onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to
        low and continue to cook and stir until onion is very tender and dark brown,
        about 40 minutes more.\r\nBring chicken broth to a boil in a large pot; stir
        in chicken breasts, reduce heat, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink
        at the center, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Remove chicken breasts
        to a plate using a slotted spoon; reserve broth.\r\nJuice potatoes with an
        electric juicer; place dry potato flesh into a bowl and discard juice. Stir
        salt and pepper into potatoes; stir in enough reserved broth to make the mixture
        the consistency of oatmeal. Set remaining broth aside.\r\nSpread half of potato
        mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Lay cooked chicken breast evenly over
        potatoes; scatter caramelized onion evenly over chicken. Spread remaining
        potato mixture over onions and chicken to cover.\r\nBake in the preheated
        oven until golden brown, about 1 hour. Reheat chicken broth; pour over individual
        servings as desired.","category":"Chicken","area":"Canadian"}}}'
